# TF2 HUB bot version beta1.17
A discord bot made to gather data from ETF2L. Find a player for your team, lookup player profiles and more. This bot is a community contributed project, every data is managed by ETF2L not by me or anyone else that contributed to this project!

## Multi-language support
The multi-language support is decided automatically, the commands will be in the language which is supported and your discord client needs to be in that language.

### Supported languages
- English US
- English UK
- Czech
- Polish

# Self-hosting
I am sorry, but the self-hosting is currently not available until the public release will be made.

# Contributors
I would like to give a big thanks to every contributor that contributed even a small part of their spare time to this project!
